# üîπ INTRODUCTION 

Palmoria Group is a manufacturing company based in Nigeria with operations across three regions. Recently, the company has come under public scrutiny after a major news outlet described it as a *‚ÄúManufacturing Patriarchy‚Äù*. The report raised concerns about gender imbalance, unequal pay, and potential non-compliance with new salary regulations.  

This negative publicity poses a serious threat to Palmoria‚Äôs ambition of expanding its operations to other regions and eventually overseas. In response, the company‚Äôs leadership commissioned a comprehensive HR analysis to uncover the root causes of these issues and provide actionable insights.  

As part of this initiative, I was engaged as an **HR Analytics Consultant** to analyze Palmoria‚Äôs workforce data, evaluate key HR metrics, and support management in making informed, equitable, and compliant decisions.  

# üéØ BUSINESS OBJECTIVE 

The goal of this analysis is to help Palmoria Group‚Äôs management team identify and address HR issues that could hinder gender equality, employee satisfaction, and compliance with industry regulations. Specifically, the objectives are to:  

1. **Assess Workforce Diversity**  
   - Understand the gender distribution across departments and regions.  
   
2. **Evaluate Performance Ratings**  
   - Compare ratings by gender to detect possible bias or imbalance.  

3. **Analyze Salary Structure**  
   - Investigate whether gender pay gaps exist within departments and regions.  

4. **Check Salary Compliance**  
   - Determine if employees meet the newly adopted $90,000 minimum salary regulation.  

5. **Examine Pay Distribution**  
   - Visualize employee distribution across salary bands (in $10,000 intervals), both company-wide and by region.  

6. **Allocate Bonuses Fairly**  
   - Calculate performance-based bonuses, integrate them into total compensation, and analyze payout by employee and region.  

7. **Provide Actionable Recommendations**  
   - Deliver data-driven insights to guide HR policies, improve fairness, and strengthen Palmoria‚Äôs reputation as it prepares for expansion.

# üõ† TOOLS USED

- **Microsoft Power BI** ‚Üí Primary tool for data modeling, dashboard design, and storytelling.  
- **Power Query Editor** ‚Üí Data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** ‚Üí Creation of calculated columns and measures (e.g., Bonus Amount, Salary + Bonus, Pay Gap %, Compliance Checks).  
- **Microsoft Excel** ‚Üí Initial review and understanding of dataset structure (bonus mapping rules, salary validation).  
- **GitHub** ‚Üí Documentation, version control, and portfolio presentation.  

# üßπ DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION

Before analysis, the dataset was reviewed and cleaned in **Power Query Editor** to ensure accuracy and consistency.  

## Key Steps Taken:
1. **Missing Values**  
   - Employees without salary ‚Üí Removed (assumed no longer employed).  
   - Blank or missing gender ‚Üí Reassigned as *"Undisclosed"*.  
   - Null departments ‚Üí Dropped (could not be mapped to any business unit).  

2. **Duplicate Records**  
   - Checked Employee Name & Department fields for duplicates.  
   - Retained unique entries only.  

3. **Salary Validation**  
   - Ensured all salary values were numeric.  
   - Corrected any incorrect formats.  

4. **Bonus Mapping Integration**  
   - Used `Palmoria Bonus Mapping` table.  
   - Merged with main employee dataset using **Department** and **Performance Rating**.  
   - Ensured each employee had the correct bonus allocation rule.  

5. **Data Type Standardization**  
   - Salary ‚Üí Currency (NAIRA).  
   - Rating ‚Üí Text/Categorical.  
   - Gender/Department/Region ‚Üí Categorical.  

‚úÖ Final dataset was clean, consistent, and ready for **Power BI modeling and visualization**.  

# üîç EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)  

The goal of EDA was to understand the overall structure of the dataset, spot early trends, and identify areas requiring deeper analysis.  

## Key Explorations Conducted:
1. **Dataset Structure**  
   - Total Employees: *500+ records (Palmoria Group)*  
   - Tables:  
     - `Palmoria Group EMP` ‚Üí Employee details (Name, Department, Gender, Salary, Region, Rating).  
     - `Palmoria Bonus Mapping` ‚Üí Bonus allocation rules (Department vs. Rating).  

2. **Gender Distribution**  
   - Counted male vs. female employees.  
   - Verified presence of "Undisclosed" category after cleaning.  

3. **Department & Regional Spread**  
   - Number of employees by **Department**.  
   - Employee distribution across **3 regions**.  

4. **Salary Overview**  
   - Average, minimum, and maximum salaries.  
   - Checked how many employees fall below the $90,000 threshold.  

5. **Performance Ratings**  
   - Distribution of employees across *Very Poor, Poor, Average, Good, Very Good*.  
   - Checked for imbalances by gender.  

6. **Bonus Allocation Readiness**  
   - Confirmed all departments were mapped to bonus rules.  
   - Previewed total bonus amounts at company level.  

‚úÖ EDA provided a clear picture of employee demographics, salary spread, and performance rating distribution ‚Äî forming the foundation for deeper Power BI visual analysis.
